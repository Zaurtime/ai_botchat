Autonomous Vehicle Bot AI project


## Introduction

*Project milestone 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Terminal.
Autonomous Vehicle Bot AI is a Python terminal bot, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The main goal of Autonomous Vehicle BOT AI is to recognise command and response quickly  in order to drive with comfort and efficiency plus with the word that the computer randomly selects. This project was inspired by The Fifth Element science fiction action film.

* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
