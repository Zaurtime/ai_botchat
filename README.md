# Introduction

Project milestone 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Terminal.
Autonomous Vehicle Bot AI is a Python terminal bot, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The main goal of Autonomous Vehicle BOT AI is to recognise command and response quickly  in order to drive with comfort and efficiency plus with the word that the computer randomly selects. This project was inspired by The Fifth Element science fiction action film.

[Live Project Here](https://ai-auto.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

* As an AI bot creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an easy app for the users to chat the bot.
2. Build an AI bot that is both enjoyable and challenging for the users.
   
* As a new autonomous vehicle bot AI owner, I want to:

1. Be able to understand the purpose of the AI chat and start drive a vechicle.
2. Be able to follow routine interacting daily with the vechicle, see the right letters appear once used right words.
3. Be able to drive and stop the car and immediatly keep moving forward if it is necessary.

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

#### Python Packages

* [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html?highlight=random#module-random): returns a random integer to get a random word

### Frameworks - Libraries - Programs Used

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    * GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com)
    * Heroku was used to deploy the live project

* [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/)
    * Lucidchart was used to create the flowchart
* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
    * The PEP8 was used to validate all the Python code
